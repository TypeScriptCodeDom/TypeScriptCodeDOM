# TypeScriptCodeDOM
TypeScript CodeDOM is based on System.CodeDom of .NET Framework and providing TypeScriptCodeProvider for generating TypeScript codes.

Fonlow.TypeScriptCodeDOM provides TypeScriptCodeProvider.

Fonlow.Poco2Ts is a code generator library that generates TypeScript codes from class definitions of POCOs (Plain Old CLR Objects).

Poco2Ts is a console application which is basically a shell program of Fonlow.Poco2Ts.

This TypeScriptCodeDOM project is a spin-off from open source project "Strongly Typed Client API Generators for ASP.NET Web API" hosted at http://webapiclientgen.codeplex.com, since TypeScriptCodeDOM had been being developed along with WebApiClientGen since v1.3.

Currently the documentation of this project is still hosted http://webapiclientgen.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=TypeScript%20CodeDOM

As more TypeScript features possibly supported by CodeDOM may be developed in the future, the documentation may be moved to GitHub as well.
